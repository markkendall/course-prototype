Let's try some simple math. Type the below command.

[Or, if you prefer, click on the command and it will be typed into the console for you!]

```bah-hint
1 + 1
```

```bah-output
1 + 1
[1] 2
```

```r
```

```bah-test
test(
  expect_equal(.Last.value, 2), "That expression didn't equal 2...  Type '1 + 1' (or click on the instructions that are preceded by an arrow), and press Enter."
)
```
